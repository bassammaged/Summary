# --------------------------  start Thread Modeling Overview -------------------------- #
    # ----- What is thread modeling?
        - TM is an approach for analyzing the security of anything, it is considered as a place where your design is under security microscope.
        - Thread Modeling is used to analyze design and mitigate the vulnerabilities.
        - qoute: "Thread modeling is like brushing your teeth, Do it early and often."


    # ----- Security feedback loop?
        1. Identify threats.
        2. Change the Design.
        3. Evaluate the mitigation.


    # ----- What is the value of threat modeling?
        1. Less security bugs to fix up and after the release.
        2. Reduces possible avenues of attack.
        3. Drives focus of security testing.


    # ----- Everyone threat modeling!
        - An example, you are going to your work and you have to pass by the school to bring your kid to there, once you open a door!
        you see the cars, dog on the right side and sun is there (hot day).
        you start to think you have to hold your kid hand to protect him/her from the cars, these time we will take left instead of right and Thanks god!
        my kid already used sun blocker.

        based on the example above, everyone can do threat modeling! by our human nature, we do it daily biases. 

    
    # ----- Instilling the habit of Threat Modeling
        1. Scope.
            - Firstly, look closer to each function/feature/module individually.
            - after that, move forward to evaluate the subsystem.
            - Entire prodcut comes in the last stage.
            => Note: by these you can focus more without any distraction. 
            a. Attack service identification:
                - Based on the scope you can identify the attack surface, is it network protocol? web interface, CLI, System daemon....!
        2. Draw.
            - Drawing DFD for each module/function.
            - The sequence diagram with data that will be send over the function/module.
            - at the final stage, as a combine between DFD and sequence diagram you can come up with the following DFD with the following shapes:
                - Data flow arrow.
                - Process.
                - Entity.
                - Data store.
                - Trust boundary 
        3. Analyze.
            - There are many of techniques to analyze the threat:
                - STRIDE technique:
                    - it is provided by microsoft and it slag for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of service and Elvation of privillege.
                        a. Spoofing: Threat action aimed at accessing and use of another userâ€™s credentials, such as username and password. (Security Control: Authentication)
                        b. Tampering: Threat action intending to maliciously change or modify persistent data, such as records in a database, and the alteration of data 
                        in transit between two computers over an open network, such as the Internet. (Security Control: Integrity)
                        c. Repudation: Threat action aimed at performing prohibited operations in a system that lacks the ability to trace the 
                        operations. (Security Control: Non-Repudiation or Accountability)
                        d. Information Disclosure: Threat action intending to read a file that one was not granted access to, or to read data in 
                        transit. (Security Control: Confidentiality)
                        e. Denial of service: Threat action attempting to deny access to valid users, such as by making a web server temporarily 
                        unavailable or unusable. (Security Control: Availability)
                        f. Elevation of privillege: Threat action intending to gain privileged access to resources in order to gain unauthorized access to information 
                        or to compromise a system. (Authorization)
        4. Mitigate.
        5. Document.  


    # ----- The 4 questions approach:
        1. What are we building?
        2. What can go wrong?
        3. What are we going to do about it?
        4. Did we do a good enough job?
