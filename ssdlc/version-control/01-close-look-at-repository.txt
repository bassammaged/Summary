    # ----- What is repository?
        - A software repository, or “repo” for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, along with metadata. 
        A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers.

        # -- respository contains:
            - Project code.
            - Project documentations.
            - Other necessary files for the projects.
            - .git: is a directory that helps the git to track changes that happen on the repository.
            - README.md, Github works show the content of "README.md" in the landing page of the project.
            - CONTRIBUTING.md: The CONTRIBUTING.md is used to describe the process for contributing to the repository. A 
            link to the CONTRIBUTING.md file is shown anytime someone creates a new issue or pull request.
            - ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md: The ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md is another file you can use to pre-populate the body of an issue. For example, if you always need the 
            same types of information for bug reports, include it in the issue template, and every new issue will be opened with your recommended starter text.
