    # ----- Why they build up the powershell?
        - In the dark ages of administration, microsoft decided to build up thier production as the following:
            1. Firstly they build the windows/server product functionality.
            2. Then microsoft builds up a powerfull GUI for administrative propose.
            3. last, they pay attention for some other ways for administrative as:
                1. WMI.
                2. COM.
                3. Command-line

        - the main concern here, the other way for administrative and that help to automate the boring and repititve tasks, they can't do anything.
        If we compared them with the GUI, they less powerfull.

        - Even you are going to build up your own script depending on those ways, your script will be limited by thier limitation too.

        - that's why powershell comes up! to solve this kind of administrative tasks and microsoft trying to compete linux's bash.
