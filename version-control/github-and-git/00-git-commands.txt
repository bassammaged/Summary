            - When you have found a commit reference to the point in history you want to visit, you can utilize the git checkout command to visit that commit. 
            Git checkout is an easy way to “load” any of these saved snapshots onto your development machine. During the normal course of development, the HEAD 
            usually points to main or some other local branch, but when you check out a previous commit, HEAD no longer points to a branch—it points directly 
            to a commit. This is called a “detached HEAD” state.
            - Viewing an old revision, It just view change (No edit)
            
            checkout commit <branch_name or commit_hash>
            git checkout -b <branch_name> # make new branch with the commit that you are display
        # -- Remove the changes that occurred in specific commits, the rest of changes happened before or after still the same.
            git revert <commit_hash_or_hashes>
        # -- goback to speicfic commit and delete any commit after it.
            - --hard flag can be used to enforce the change and remove the changes of deleted commits.
            git reset <commit_hash>

    # ----- Branches
        # -- Create branch
            git branch <branch_name>
        
        # -- switch the active branch
            git checkout <branch_name>

        # -- Create and switch the branch
            git checkout -b <branch_name>

        # -- Delete branch
            git branch -d <branch_name>

    # ----- Show status of repository
        # -- show modified files, committed files
            git status
