    # ----- what is commits?
        - The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a
        project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit.

        # -- stages:
            1. Modified:
                - The files have been changes, but not commited.
            2. Staging:
                - The changes has been added to staging phase to be ready for commit.
            3. Commited:
                - Its like the save point in the game, you could go back to one of them or even forward.
