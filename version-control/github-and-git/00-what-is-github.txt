    # ----- What is github?
    - At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to 
    their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:
        1. Version control
        2. Git

    - after reading about version control and git, let's discuss more about github, GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository 
    hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
    GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical 
    savvy and use of the command line.

    # -- What features are provided by github?
        1. User-friendly for git.
        2. Issues.
        3. Branching and merging (GIT).
        4. Historical tracking (GIT).
        5. Pull Request.
        6. Capability to intergrate new services with git/github
    # ----- What is version control?
         - Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. 
            Take WordPress… At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, 
            it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.
        - version control lets developers safely work through "branching" and "merging".
        - All changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.

        # -- Branching?
            - With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the "repository"). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of 
            the code without affecting the rest of the project.
        
        # -- Merging! what is it?
            - Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to 
            make it official.

        
    # ----- What is git?
        - Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
        - Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, 
        which allows for easy branching and merging.
