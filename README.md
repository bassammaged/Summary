# What's summary repo?
I had got through many of many techonolgies that I had learnt, after a while! I figured out when I be far away from the technology that I learnt before usually I forget about it and its necessary to start over again to learn it.

So, I decided to summarize all things that I learnt and require an surplus effort, but overall the result its more than my expectation always I return back to my summaries when I stuck in something or forget things that I learnt.
