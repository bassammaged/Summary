    # ----- What is domain email spoofed?
        - Is a technique used in sending phishing attacks to trick users into thinking a message came from a person or entitiy they know or can trust.
        the sender forges email headers even the misconfiguration for records like SPF,DKIM and DMARC allows the attacker to spoof the domain itself.

    # ----- Impact:
        - Information discolsure.
        - Hooked the end-user.
        - Deliver mailicous content as attachement.
        - etc..

    # ----- Mitigation:
        - Apply SPF record.
        - Set DKIM record.
        - Implement DMARC bannar.
    
        # ----- How SPF works:
            # ----- What the role of SPF?
                - An SPF TXT record is a DNS record that helps prevent spoofing and phishing by verifying the domain name from which email messages are sent. 
                SPF validates the origin of email messages by verifying the IP address of the sender against the alleged owner of the sending domain.
                - SPF record contains information identifies authorized outbound email servers. Destination email systems verify that messages originate from 
                authorized outbound email servers.

            # ----- SPF record contains:
                - record: v=spf1 [<ip4>|<ip6>:<IP address>] [include:<domain name>] <enforcement rule>
                    - v=<verison>:          version of SPF record.
                    - <ip address>:         Allowed IP that trusted to send an email on behalf of you.
                    - <domain name>:        Allowed domain that trusted to send an email on behalf of you.
                    - <enforcement rule>:   Could be hard fail, soft fail, neutral.
                        - hard fail: Mark the message with 'hard fail' in the message envelope and then follow the receiving server's configured 
                        spam policy for this type of message.
                        - Soft fail: Mark the message with 'soft fail' in the message envelope. Typically, email servers are configured to deliver 
                        these messages anyway. Most end users do not see this mark.
                        - Neutral: Do nothing, that is, do not mark the message envelope. This is usually reserved for testing purposes and is rarely used.

            # ----- How it works?
                1. Domain administrators publish SPF information in TXT records in DNS.
                2. v=spf1 <IP address #1> <IP address #2> <IP address #3> <enforcement rule>
                    example: v=spf1 124.251.124.17 include:secranix.net include:secranix.org -all
                3. Configure SPF record on your mail server, for example: Microsoft 365 mail server.

            # ----- V.I Note:
                - Although SPF is designed to help prevent spoofing, but there are spoofing techniques that SPF cannot protect against. In order to 
                protect against these, once you have set up SPF, you should also configure DKIM and DMARC

        # ----- How DKIM works:
            - DKIM stand for Domain Keys Identified Mail, is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was 
            indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain. This is done by giving the email a digital signature. This DKIM signature is 
            a header that is added to the message and is secured with encryption.

            # ----- What to consider before creating the DKIM record?
                1. Determine which domains are allowed to send outbound mail on its behalf.
                2. Create the DKIM public/private keys and the policy record. The ‘public’ key will be used in your public-facing DNS TXT record 
                along with what’s called a policy record.
                    - The ‘private’ key will be used on your sending MTA. When an outbound message is sent from the sending MTA, it will add the 
                    private key to the message header for identification and validation by the receiving domain by way of the public key. This uses 
                    a new domain name identifier to digitally sign the message.
                3. Create TXT records using the DKIM information created from these wizards. Be sure to include DKIM records for all of your applicable
                    example: v=DKIM1;k=rsa;p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDeIhtCv3vUinyhKiKtZ8efjHGGo8gE1T+o7gLrvo6yRtdz9ICe6Fz5sgz0WYFW5nCV4DmaTcS25TfgWKsLggGSBdDxzShyvgdKJkG3b4+73rT/5opnRceqQf1qndnMZfkb/0/YciMKNQmigj9IGwKypj6CoIr1s46jRGy4Ws7LQIDAQAB
                sending domains. These records will be included in your public facing DNS record for each sending domain.
                4. Be sure that your existing sending MTA’s support DKIM. 
                        
            # ----- DKIM how it works?
                - Create A DKIM-Signature:
                    1. Boil off the "trivial bits" of an email.
                    2. Create two hashes, hash for email body and hash for headers.
                    3. Sender has access to private key.
                    4. Sender craetes crypto signature.
                    5. DKIM-Signature added to email.
                    6. DKIM-Sig has all things needed to verify.
                    7. Email sent on its way.

                - verify A DKIM-Signature:
                    1. Boil off the "trivial bits" of an email.
                    2. Create two hashes, hash for email body and hash for headers.
                    3. Retrieve public key from the DNS record.
                    4. Crypto-sign in DKIM-signature is verified.

        # ----- How DMARC works:
            - DMARC stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance. It is an email authentication standard that secures 
            email senders and receivers from email-based attacks like spamming, email domain spoofing, and phishing. 
            - It is a technical standard that allows an organization to authenticate their emails and set policies by aligning SPF 
            (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (Domain Key Identified Mail) standards. Along with SPF and DKIM, it allows an organization to set 
            email authentication rules to reject or quarantine emails from unauthorized resources. 

            # ----- What is DMARC record:
                - record: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:F4EXVjm@rua.kdmarc.com; ruf=mailto:F4EXVjm@ruf.kdmarc.com; fo=1;
                    - v=<version>       : indicates the DMARC version
                    - p=<policy>        : indicated the applied DMARC policy
                        - policy could be:
                            - reject: The Reject policy is the most recommended policy as it secures all your emails. It ensures that any email that 
                            fails the DMARC check is not delivered to the receiver at all. 
                            - quarantie: unauthorized emails are sent to the spam folder. It allows email receivers to send DMARC failed emails in 
                            quarantine i.e. to the junk folder. 
                            - approve/none: This policy monitors your email traffic and does not take any specific action for emails that fail DMARC check. 
                            You can use this policy to gather DMARC reports and analyze data in those reports.
                    - rua	            : A list of URIs for ISPs to send XML feedback to.
                    - ruf               : A list of URIs for ISPs to send forensic reports to.
                    - rf                : The reporting format for forensic reports.
