# ------------------------------- start enumeration ------------------------------- # 
    ==> Quick view: NFS can be found on 2049 TCP and UDP, RPC-based and relies on other RPC services
    such as portmapper service which found on port 111 TCP and UDP.
    ==> Configuration file: nfs server configuration usually be found in the /etc/exports 
    # ---------- |nmap| ---------- #
        nmap --script nfs-ls,nfs-showmount,nfs-statfs <ip_address>
    
    # ---------- |showmount| ---------- #
        showmount -e <ip_address>

        ==> explanation: showmount -e <ip_address>
        # built-in command to show exports/shared content. 
        # in case of return was /var/www * mean no IP restricted on this directory, otherwise will be restricted  /var/www 192.168.2.4

    ==> V.I Note: if all paths are restricted, the IPs that disclosured are still useful in lateral movement.
# -------------------------------   end enumeration ------------------------------- # 

# ------------------------------- start exploit through mount ------------------------------- # 
    ==> Quick view: start exploit misconfigured NFS service through mounting
    mount -t nfs <nfs_server_ip>:<path> <local_path> -o nolock

        ==> explanation: mount -t nfs <nfs_server_ip>:<path> <local_path> -o nolock
        # mount <path> from nfs_server_ip to your <local_path>
# -------------------------------   end exploit through mount ------------------------------- #
