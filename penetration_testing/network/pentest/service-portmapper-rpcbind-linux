    ==> Quick view: portmapper (AKA rpcbind) is common service found on linux-based system
    is used to essentially "map" RPC. Corresponding 111 or 32771 TCP and UDP ports on a target system.
    it gives us knwoeldge of which ports the system has open locally (bound to localhost), which we 
    couldn't normally identify with a usual port scan.
    ==> Configuration file: nfs server configuration usually be found in the /etc/exports 
    # ---------- |nmap| ---------- #
        nmap --script rpc-bind,rpcinfo <ip_address> -p <port_no>

        ==> explanation: nmap --script rpc-bind,rpcinfo <ip_address> -p <port_no>
        # retreive port/proto, service, version
    
    # ---------- |rpcinfo| ---------- #
        rpcinfo -p <ip_address>

        ==> explanation: rpcinfo -p <ip_address>
        # alternative to nmap --script rpc-bind,rpcinfo <ip_address> -p <port_no>
