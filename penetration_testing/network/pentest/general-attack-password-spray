# ------------------------------- start password spray attack overview ------------------------------- # 
    ==> Quick popularity as a "go-to" method for gaining access to systems via dictionary 
    attacks due to its sucess-rate in the wild.
    rather than the usual dictionary brute force methods involving a dictionary of hundreds if not millions
    of password entries, the idea is to reverse the process and instead, introduce a list of as many users as 
    possible, while trying just a single password attempt against tens of hundreds of user accounts.
    another name: "Reverse brute-force attack".
