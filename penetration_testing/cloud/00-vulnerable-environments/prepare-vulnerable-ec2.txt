# -------------------- Start Prepare vulnerable linux instance -------------------- #
    # ----- Install EC2
        1. Using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS/Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Avaliable at AWS marketplace).
        2. All configurations remain the same except (Region, VPC, Subnet)
            - Choose the closest regoin for you.
            - Make sure the VPC and subnet that you are going to choose are the same for next installations.

    # ----- prepare the vulnerable software
        # -- Establish ssh connection
            ssh -i <pem file> <IP address of the instance>
        # -- Update the OS.
            sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
        # -- Install vulnerable software vsftpd 2.3.4
            git clone https://github.com/nikdubois/vsftpd-2.3.4-infected.git
            sudo apt-get install build-essential
            cd vsftpd
            nano Makefile
            add -lcrypt value to link flag
            [save the changes]
            make
            [we should see a vsftpd binary in the same folder]

            [we need to set up some prerequisites before installing vsftpd. Namely, we need to add a user called nobody and a folder called empty]
            useradd nobody
            mkdir /usr/share/empty
            
            [Once done, we can run the installation by executing the following commands]
            sudo cp vsftpd /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd
            sudo cp vsftpd.8 /usr/local/man/man8
            sudo cp vsftpd.conf.5 /usr/local/man/man5
            sudo cp vsftpd.conf /etc

            [Run vsftpd in background]
            sudo /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd &
            [Check the FTP]
            ftp localhost

            [Enable anonymous access]
            sudo mkdir /var/ftp/
            sudo useradd -d /var/ftp ftp
            sudo chown root:root /var/ftp
            sudo chmod og-w /var/ftp
            [Edit local login in /etc/vsftpd.conf]
            uncomment local_enable=YES

# -------------------- Start Prepare vulnerable Windows instance -------------------- #
    # ---- Install EC2
        - Using Windows server 2003
        - Using same VPC and subnet ID of linux EC2.
        - Access via RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
            1. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) doesn't support certificate-based authentication, we need to provide the private key to decrypt and get the 
            password using which we can log in. 
                - This is done by simply right-clicking on the instance and selecting Get Windows Password.
                - On the following screen, we are required to upload the private key that was downloaded earlier.
                - Once done, simply clicking on Decrypt Password will provide us with the password that we can use to RDP into our Windows server instance
                - Configure security group to allow RDP connections.

    # ----- Installing vulnerable software (SQL injection Demo)
        - Install XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
        - Clone https://github.com/FrancescoBorzi/sql-injection-demo
        - Connect to t http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin
        - Create new database: sqli
        - Importing file: database.sql
        - Copy sql-injection-demo to htdocs of XAMPP
# --------------------   end Prepare vulnerable Windows instance -------------------- #

# -------------------- start Security group configuration -------------------- #
    # ----- Configure Security group
        1. All Instances are located in the same VPC and subnet which allow to communicate with the private IPs.
        2. Allow connection between Kali and Ubuntu on FTP server.
        3. Allow connection between Kali and windows on port 80.
        4. Open connectio between Ubuntu and windows (all ports)
