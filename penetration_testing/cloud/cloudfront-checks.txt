    # ----- Security Checks:
        - [Test] HTTP Smuggling
        - [Test] Forward headers
        - [Test] CloudFront Hijacking
        - [Both] Missing default root object configured
        - [Both] Enforce encryption in transit
        - [Audit] No origin access identity enabled
        - [Audit] Check if origin failover is configured
        - [Audit] Logging is enabled
        - [Audit] AWS WAF is enabled

    # ----- CloudFront Hijacking
        # -- When a CloudFront endpoint receives a request, it does NOT automatically serve content from the corresponding distribution. Instead, CloudFront uses 
        the HOST header of the request to determine which distribution to use. This means two things:
            1. If the HOST header does not match a domain in the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field of the intended distribution, the request will fail.
            2. Any other CloudFront distribution that contains the specific domain in the HOST header will receive the request and respond to it normally.
    
        # -- Test case:
            1. Enumerate all end-points (domains and subdomains) that pointed to IPs or CNAMEs for CloudFront.
            2. Analyze all subdomains that having CNAMEs to those end-points.
            3. Trying to access the subdomians and the analyze the CloudFront response.    

    # ----- Missing default root object configured
        # -- This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured to return a specific object that is the default root object. The control 
        fails if the CloudFront distribution does not have a default root object configured. [Covered by Security Hub]
    
        # -- Test case:
            1. Enumerate all end-points are behind the CloudFront.
            2. Try to access them without direct without any specifiy directory/file. 
                - https://kemet.com ==> 11111.cloudfront.com then try to access https://kemet.com without any directory or file specified.

    # ----- No origin access identity enabled
        # -- This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution with Amazon S3 Origin type has Origin Access Identity (OAI) 
        configured. [Covered by Security Hub]

    # ----- Enforce encryption in transit
        # -- This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution requires viewers to use HTTPS directly or whether it uses redirection. 
        The control fails if ViewerProtocolPolicy is set to allow-all for defaultCacheBehavior or for cacheBehaviors. [Covered by Security Hub]

    # ----- Check if origin failover is configured
        # -- This control checks whether an Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured with an origin group that has two or more origins. [Covered by Security Hub]

    # ----- Logging is enabled
        # -- This control checks whether server access logging is enabled on CloudFront distributions. The control fails if access logging is not enabled 
        for a distribution. [Covered by Security Hub]
    # ----- AWS WAF is enabled
        # -- This control checks whether CloudFront distributions are associated with either AWS WAF or AWS WAFv2 web ACLs. The control fails if 
        the distribution is not associated with a web ACL. [Covered by Security Hub]
