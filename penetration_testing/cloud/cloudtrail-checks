    # ----- Security Checks:
        - [Audit] Which zones' logs logged by Cloudtrail
        - [Audit] Check logging event types
        - [Audit] Enable logs encryption on s3 by using AWS-KMS
        - [Audit] Enable file validation 
        - [Audit] Check status of cloudtrail
        - [Audit] AWS APIs that not supported by Cloudtrail

    # ----- Which zones' logs logged by Cloudtrail
        # -- Identify the zones are covered by cloudtrails.

    # ----- Check logging event types
        # -- Cloudtrail can logging management events and data events.
        # -- Check the configuration on the level of cloudtrail itself.
    
    # ----- Enable logs encryption on s3 by using AWS-KMS
        # -- Encrypt the storing logs while they are stored in S3 the keys managed by AWS Key Management

    # ----- Enable file validation
        # -- Cloudtrail will store digest files to the s3 bucket alongside the logs, incase of tampering of logs file will can be detected by digest files.

    # ----- AWS APIs that not supported by Cloudtrail
        # -- The reasons why a service does not support CloudTrail logging can vary. For example, a service that is still in preview, or not yet 
        released for general availability (GA), is not considered supported for CloudTrail logging.

    # ----- Cloudtrails on the level of organization:
        1. IsMultiRegionalTrail is for across region support.
        2. IncludeGlobalServiceEvents, if it has true value that mean cloudtrail logs non-region-specific logs such as IAM.
        3. LogFileValidationEnabled, for digest files feature.
        4. KmsKeyId, if it the value of KmsKeyId exist that mean the encryption has been applied.
        5. HasCustomEventSelectors, true value indicators to cloudtrail is logging data events.
    # ----- On the level of CloudTrail:
        1. ReadWriteType is set to All, which means we are recording both read and write events, and not just one of them.
        2. IncludeManagementEvents is set to true, which means the trail is logging management events.
        3. DataResources has value of data events id that will be recorded, for example:S3 object logging is enabled for the bucket with the 
        ARN arn:aws:s3:::bucket-for-lambda-pentesting/
    # ----- Status of CloudTrail:
        1. IsLogging key is set to true. If it is set to false, then that means the trail is disabled.
        2. LatestDeliveryAttemptTime and LatestDeliveryAttemptSucceeded keys to ensure that logs are being delivered correctly.
