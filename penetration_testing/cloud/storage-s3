    # ----- What is S3?
        - s3 stands for Simple Storage solution, store files in form of Object in directory structure.
        - Provide many of advantages:
            1. Cheap reiable way to stire objects.
            2. Low latency, High throuput access.
            3. Can easily be used to host static websites.
            4. Can intergare with SNS, SQS, Lambda for powerful event driven application.
             
        # -- S3 settings:
            - Object ownership:
                - By default S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded the object! that's why AWS introduced a new feature.
                - AWS S3 object ownership is a new S3 feature that enables bucket owners to automatically assume ownership of objects that are uploaded to their
                bukets by other AWS accounts.

            - Setting options:
                1. ACLs disabled (Recommended):
                    - All objects in this bucket are owned by this account. Access to this bucket and its objects is specified using only policies.
                
                2. ACLs enabled:
                    - Objects in this bucket can be owned by other AWS accounts. Access to this bucket and its objects can be specified using ACLs.
                    - ACLs enabled has two sub-options
                        a. Bucket owner preferred: Bucket and object ACLs are accepted and honored. New objects that are uploaded with 
                        the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL are automatically owned by the bucket owner rather than the object writer. Objects 
                        uploaded without this canned ACL are owned by the object writer. All other ACL behaviors remain in place. This setting does not 
                        affect ownership of existing objects. To require all Amazon S3 PUT operations to include the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL, 
                        add a bucket policy  that only allows object uploads using this ACL.

                        b. Object writer: Objects are owned by the AWS account that uploads them, even if the object writer is in a different account than 
                        the bucket owner. You, as the bucket owner, can't use bucket policies to grant access to objects owned by other AWS accounts. The 
                        object writer or you, when you receive appropriate permission from the object writer via object ACL, manage access permissions for 
                        these objects in object ACLs.

                3. Public access setting:
                    - Block all public access: 
                        Public access is granted to buckets and objects through access control lists (ACLs), bucket policies, access point policies, or all. In 
                        order to ensure that public access to this bucket and its objects is blocked, turn on Block all public access.
                    
                        Note: AWS recommends that you turn on Block all public access, but before applying any of these settings, ensure that your 
                        applications will work correctly without public access.

                        # -- Avalilable options:
                            1. Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
                                - S3 will block public access permissions applied to newly added buckets or objects, and prevent the creation of new public 
                                access ACLs for existing buckets and objects. This setting doesnâ€™t change any existing permissions that allow public access 
                                to S3 resources using ACLs.

                            2. Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
                                - S3 will ignore all ACLs that grant public access to buckets and objects.
                            
                            3. Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies
                                - S3 will block new bucket and access point policies that grant public access to buckets and objects. This setting doesn't 
                                change any existing policies that allow public access to S3 resources

                            4. Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
                                - S3 will ignore public and cross-account access for buckets or access points with policies that grant public access to 
                                buckets and objects.
