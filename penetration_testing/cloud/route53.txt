    # ----- What is route 53?
        - Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an 
        extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP 
        addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully compliant with IPv6 as well.

        - Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load 
        balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets – and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS. 

        # -- Example on AWS route 53
            - AWS CLI command (we can leave the --region argument out for Route 53):
                The output should look something like this:
                    {
                        "HostedZones": [
                            {
                                "Id": "/hostedzone/A22EWJRXPPQ21T",
                                "Name": "test.com.",
                                "CallerReference": "1Y89122F-2364-8G1E-P925-2B8OO1338Z31",
                                "Config": {
                                    "Comment": "An example Hosted Zone",
                                    "PrivateZone": false
                                    },
                                "ResourceRecordSetCount": 5
                            }
                        ]
                    }

                - "PrivateZone" is set to false ==> public hosted zone
                -  "ResourceRecordSetCount" is 5 ==> Five records

        # -- AWS CLI Commands:
            - Retrieve el records:
                aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id A22EWJRXPPQ21T
