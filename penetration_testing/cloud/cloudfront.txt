    # ----- What is CloudFront?
        - Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to 
        your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. 
        - CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the 
        best possible performance.

    # ----- How you set up CloudFront to deliver content?
        1. You specify origin servers, like an Amazon S3 bucket or your own HTTP server, from which CloudFront gets your files which will then be 
        distributed from CloudFront edge locations all over the world.
        2. You upload your files to your origin servers. Your files, also known as objects, typically include web pages, images, and media files, 
        but can be anything that can be served over HTTP.
        3. You create a CloudFront distribution, which tells CloudFront which origin servers to get your files from when users request the files through 
        your web site or application.
        4. you specify details such as whether you want CloudFront to log all requests and whether you want the distribution to be enabled as soon as it's created.
        5. CloudFront assigns a domain name to your new distribution that you can see in the CloudFront console.
