    # ----- What is cloud?
        - "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in 
        data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software 
        applications on their own machines.
    
    # ----- How does cloud computing work?
        - Cloud computing is possible because of a technology called virtualization. Virtualization allows for the creation of a simulated, digital-only "virtual" 
        computer that behaves as if it were a physical computer with its own hardware. The technical term for such a computer is virtual machine.

        - Isolation: When properly implemented, virtual machines on the same host machine are sandboxed from one another, so they do not interact with each other 
        at all, and the files and applications from one virtual machine are not visible to the other virtual machines even though they are on the same 
        physical machine.
