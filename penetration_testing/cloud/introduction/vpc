    # ----- What is VPC?
        - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a 
        traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

        - A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. 
        You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, 
        associate security groups, and configure route tables.

        - VPC by default support IPV4 CIDR and could be support IPV6 CIDR.

        # -- Regions
            - Each Amazon EC2 Region is designed to be isolated from the other Amazon EC2 Regions. This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.
            - When you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the Region that you specified. This is because Regions are isolated from each other, 
            and we don't automatically replicate resources across Regions.

            - Example on regions 
                Code	        Name	                Opt-in Status
                us-east-2	US East (Ohio)	            Not required
                us-east-1	US East (N. Virginia)	    Not required
                us-west-1	US West (N. California)	    Not required

        # -- Availability zones:
            - Each Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. The code for Availability Zone is its Region code followed by a letter identifier. For example, us-east-1a
    
    
        # -- What is subnet?
            - A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must 
            be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won't be connected to the internet. 

            # -- Reserved IPs:
                - Let's suppose the subnet CIDR is 10.0.0.1/24. So, the following IPs will be reserved by AWS.
                    10.0.0.1/24 for the router/gateway.
                    10.0.0.2/24 for AWS DNS
                    10.0.0.3/24 for future use
                    
        # -- Security group
            - Security group like a virtual firewall. It has inbound and outbound security rules in which all inbound traffic is blocked by default in private on AWS EC2.
