# --------------- Start dynamic code analysis --------------- #
    # ----- What is dynamic code analysis:
        - Dynamic code analysis is a process by which code is reviewed for vulnerabilities by executing some or all of the code. this execution can occur in a 
        normal environment, virtualized environment or in a debugger.

        - While the application is executing, you can directly examine the changes made to memory or the file system as they occur.
        - Also, allows you to directly observe network requests, interactions wuth other applications and the result of any error conditions encountered.

        # -- Debugging:
            - There are numerous methods to debug applications:
                1. Android studio built-in debugger: as described here: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/index.html#groovy
                    - this approach works best for apps where you have or can obtain the original source.
                    # -- debug based on application element:
                        - If its application element sets the value of its android:debuggable="true" attribute to true. that's mean android will manage all logs 
                        file regarding your application.

    # ----- Dynamic analysis tools:
        # -- ADB:
            - you can check the "./android-tool-dast-adb" file

        # -- frida:
            - you can check the "./android-tool-dast-frida" file.
