# ------------------- start data storage ------------------- #
    # ----- what is data storage:
        The most common security concern for an application on Android is whether the data that you save on the device is accessible to other apps. There are 
        three fundamental ways to save data on the device:
        - Internal storage.
        - External storage.
        - Content providers.


    # ----- Type of local storage:
        1. Local files.
            a. internal storage.
            b. external storage.
            c. shared preferences.
        2. Local database (SQLite).
        3. content provider.

        # -- Internal storage:
            - By default internal sotrage accessiable only to your app.
            - Security tips:
                1. Generally avoid the MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE or MODE_WORD_READABLE.
                2. Encrypt the internal storage using security library which provde encryptedFile class.

            - Location of the internal storage:
                1. Internal sotrage usually be stored in /data/data/<app_package_name>
                2. Internal storage for the system apps in /system/app or /system/priv-app

        # -- External storage:
            - Files created on external storage, such as SD cards, are globally readable and writable. Because external storage can be removed by the user and also 
            modified by any application, don't store sensitive information using external storage.
            - Location of the external storage:
                1. /sdcard
                2. /mnt/sdcard
            - there is a require permission "WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"

        # -- shared preferences:
            - One of the most Interesting Data Storage option Android provides its users is Shared Preferences. Shared Preferences is the way in which one 
            can store and retrieve small amounts of primitive data as key/value pairs to a file on the device storage such as String, int, float, Boolean 
            that make up your preferences in an XML file inside the app on the device storage.
                four different mode for share preferences:
                    1. MODE_PRIVATE: defaukt mode where the creted file can only be accessed by the calling application or by an applications with the same user id.
                    2. MODE_WORLD_READABLE: all other applications have read access to the file.
                    3. MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE: all other applications have write access to the file.
                    4. MODE_APPEND: if the file already exist, write data to the end.

    # ------ what is insecure data storage:
        Storage data within the device, with no any access restriction, misconfigured premission, with no layer of encryption.
