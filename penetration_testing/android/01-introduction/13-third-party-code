    # ----- What is third party code:
        - In computer programming, a third-party software component is a reusable software component developed to be either freely distributed or sold by 
        an entity other than the original vendor of the development platform. The third-party software component market thrives because many programmers believe 
        that component-oriented development improves the efficiency and the quality of developing custom applications. Common third-party software includes macros, 
        bots, and software/scripts to be run as add-ons for popular developing software.

            # -- type of third party code:
                1. SDK 
                    - SDK or software development kit are generally classes or .jar files. which make it easier for developers to interface with code written by 
                    third parties, these files are directly included into other apps which use them.
                    - Example: Facebook SDK, allows apps to implement a "login with facebook functionaity".
                    
                    # -- security concerns:
                        1. SDK is a part of the application and any flaws in the SDK could affect the entire application so, developer has to pay his/her attention to 
                        make sure the SDK developers bring security to their SDKs.
                
                2. Library:
                    - is a collection of pre-built compiled code which you can use to extend your application's features. For example, you may 
                    need to show some graphics in your application. Instead of creating this from scratch, you may choose to use a pre-built library someone 
                    else has developed which will give you the features you need thus saving you some time.

                    # -- security concerns:
                        1. Same as SDK security concerns.
