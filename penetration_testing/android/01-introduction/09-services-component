    # ----- What is services?
                - A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background. It does not provide a user interface. Once started, 
                a service might continue running for some time, even after the user switches to another application. Additionally, a component can bind to a 
                service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). For example, a service can handle network transactions, play music, 
                perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background.

    # ----- Types of Services:
        1. Foreground
            - A foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. For example, an audio app would use a foreground service to play an 
            audio track. Foreground services must display a Notification. Foreground services continue running even when the user isn't interacting with the app.
            - When you use a foreground service, you must display a notification so that users are actively aware that the service is running. This notification 
            cannot be dismissed unless the service is either stopped or removed from the foreground.
        2. Background
            - A background service performs an operation that isn't directly noticed by the user. For example, if an app used a service to compact its storage, that 
            would usually be a background service.
        3. Bound
            A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService(). A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows 
            components to interact with the service, send requests, receive results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC). 
            A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it. Multiple components can bind to the service at once, but when 
            all of them unbind, the service is destroyed.

    # ------ Main syntax for services:
        - To create a service, you must create a subclass of Service or use one of its existing subclasses. 

        - onStartCommand(): To allow components to start it.
        - onBind():         To allow binding.
        - startService():   It will run indefintiely.
        - stopService():    Invoking to stop the service.
        - bindService():    Start the service as blind.
