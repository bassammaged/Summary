    # ----- what are Android Core Building Blocks?
        1. Activity
            - An activity is a class that represents a single screen. It is like a Frame in AWT.
        2. View
            - A view is the UI element such as button, label, text field etc. Anything that you see is a view.
        3. Intent
            - Intent is used to invoke components. It is mainly used to:
                a. Start the service
                b. Launch an activity
                c. Display a web page
                d. Display a list of contacts
                e. Broadcast a message
                f. Dial a phone call etc.
            - example:
                Intent secranix = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);  
                secranix.setData(Uri.parse("http://www.secranix.com"));  
                startActivity(secranix);  
        4. Service
            - Service is a background process that can run for a long time.
            - There are two type of services (Local service, Remote service):
                a. Local service: service is accessed from within the application only.
                b. Remote service: service is accessed remotely from other applications running on the same device.
        5. Content Provider
            - Content Providers are used to share data between the applications.
        6. Fragment
            - Fragments are like parts of activity. An activity can display one or more fragments on the screen at the same time.
        7. AndroidManifest.xml
            - It contains informations about activities, content providers, permissions etc. It is like the web.xml file in Java EE.
