    ==> Quick view:  Each web service request contains some sort of operation that is later executed by the application logic. This operation can be found 
    in the first child element of the SOAP Body. However, if HTTP is used to transport the SOAP message the SOAP standard allows the use of an 
    additional HTTP header element called SOAPAction.


    ==> sub attacks:
        - SOAPAction Spoofing - MITM Attack
            - Assume that an attacker is able to modify a SOAP message in transit send between web service client and web service receiver. 
            If the receiving web service is vulnerable to the SOAPAction Spoofing attack, the attacker can insert a operation in the SOAPAction attribut that gets executed by 
            the web service receiver. As a result, a operation that was not intended by the sender got executed in his name.

        - SOAPAction Spoofing - Bypass Attack
            - Certain web services are protected by separate gateways that check only the operation of the SOAP body against a whitelist.
