    ==> Quick view: the session identifier is the unique key that identifies a user session
                    with a database of sessions.
                    it is critical to the session management mechanism because, if an attacker
                    manages to obtain it, he can impersonate or ride another user's session.

    ==> strong session cretria:
        - valid for only a single session.
        - time limited.
        - purely random (unpredictable).

    ==> Very important to not store session tokens in:
        - URL: the session token will be leaked to external sites through referrer header and in the user browser history.
        - HTML: the session token could be cached in the brwoser or intermediate proxies.
        - HTML5 web storage:
            - localstorage: will last until it is explicitly deleted, so this may make session last too long.
            - sessionstorage: is only destoryed when the browser is closed, there may be users will not close their browser in a long time.
