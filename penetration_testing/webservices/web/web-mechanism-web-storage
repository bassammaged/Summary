    ==> Quick view: HTML5 allows websites to store data locally in the browser. this is done by 
                    accessing the localStorage and the sessionStorage object via JavaScript.

    ==> Different between web storage and cookie:
        - Size: Cookie size limited to 4KB, localStorage from 5MB to 10MB.
        - Interface: cookies are accessed by client/server and transffered over HTTP connections.
        localStorage is known only to the browser.
        - Data model: cookies represent a complex structure, web storage provides a simpler interface by using an associative array data model.

    ==> web storage types:
        - localStorage.
        - sessionStorage.

    ==> local storage:
        - HTML pages loaded by the browser and sahring the same origin will use the same local storage.
        - lifetime:
            - web application deletes storage through localStorage API.
            - user deletes storage using the browser cleaning feature.
    
    ==> sessionStorage:
        - bound to the browser window where a website is open, if a broswer has ten tabs pointing to same URL "example1.com/index.html"
        each of them will have its own sessionStorage object.
        - lifetime
            - web application deletes storage through sessionStorage API.
            - user deletes storage using the browser cleaning feature.
            - user closes the browser window. 

    ==> IndexedDB:
       IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes 
       to enable high-performance searches of this data.
