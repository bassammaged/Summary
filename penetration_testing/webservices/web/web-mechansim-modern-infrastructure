    # ---------- Modern infrastructure:
        - Currently our connection that established cis not handled by one single server. In our days: web application might consist of 
        serveral servers serve the app (application server, database server).

        Client (1) ---------------- WAF (2) ------------- Revere proxy/Loadbalancer (3) ------------ Firewall (4)
                                                                                                        |
                             database server (7) --------------  firewall (optional) (6) --------- app server (5)

        - The new infrastructure design provide extra security and avialbility through caching and presenting users with a cached version of a website.
        
        - Critical configuration for example:
            - reverse proxy/loadbalancer is usually redirect user based on host header. 
            - reverse proxy/loadbalancer is providing caching based on rules for example extensions.
