# ------------------------------- start SAML overview ------------------------------- #
    # --------- What is SAML?
        - SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. defines an XML-based framework for describing and exchanging security information between on-line business
        partners. this security information is expressed in the form of portable SAML assemtions that applications working across security domain boundaries can trust.
        the OASIS SAML standard defines percise syntax and rules for requesting, creating, communicating and use SAML assertions.

        - SAML comes to play to provide client identity to different service providers through IdP (identity provider), really cernteralized authentication.

    # --------- Main components
        - User-agent: represent the client who want to accecss specific service provider.
        - IdP: stands for Identity provider that grant access the user to service providers.
        - SP: stands for service providers which are the application the client want to access.
        - SAML assertion: ????

    # --------- overview: how SAML works?
        - There are two ways for initiate SAML SSO authentication:
            - IdP-INIT method
                1. Client starts with authentication IdP.
                2. After authentication, IdP issue SAML assertion that allows the client to access SP.
                3. IdP send back SAML assertion to the client to allow the client to access thier service.
                4. Client send SAML assertion through POST request to SP to gain the access.
                5. SP validate the SAML assertion then establish the session with the user.
            
            - SP-INIT method
                1. Client start to reach out the SP, incase the user is not authenticated the SP start to redirect the user to IdP.
                2. Client starts with authentication IdP.
                3. After authentication, IdP issue SAML assertion that allows the client to access SP.
                4. IdP send back SAML assertion to the client to allow the client to access thier service.
                5. Client send SAML assertion through POST request to SP to gain the access.
                6. SP validate the SAML assertion then establish the session with the user.

        - V.I Note: IdP and SP have trust relation between them to using SAML SSO protocol.

    # --------- IdP and SP trust relation: How it starts?
        - pre-request:
            1. IdP has its configuration and certificate that clarified through 'IdP XML metadata' file.
            2. SP XML has its own configuration and certificate that already identified "SP XML metadata".

        - IdP and SP exchange thier metadata that help them to understanding exchange the data between them easily.

        # --------- Metadata:
            - Metadata contains: 
                1. the user identifier: such as email (Both side must configurate the same).
                2. certificate: for sign SAML assertion and used in validate the issuer and trust it.
                3. Entity identifier: used is unique identifier for the idP or SP. for example IdP xml metadata will contain identifier for IdP itself.
                4. Exchange metadata method: the both of them must have a deal how they echange the SAML assertion.
                5. Method of authentication: describe client who authenticated with IdP (IdP xml metadata contains this band).

    # --------- SAML assertion components:
        1. NameID: client identifier such as email.
        2. Method of authentication: that describe who the client has ahtneticated with IdP and this method must be allowed from SP.
        3. Attributes: IdP add attribute such as Group membership to idnetify the level of the user.
        4. Conditions: SAML assertion contains some Conditions such as how long it will be valid for, condition protect it from relay attack.
        5. Issuer ID: identify IdP.
        6. SAML singature: the whole SAML assertion must be hashed and sign by the issuer (IdP). to be verified from SP.

    # --------- SAML 2.0 Bindings:
        - Let's us think about how many ways could be follow to exchange SAML:
            1. SAML SOAP binding (Based SAML 1.1).
            2. Reverse SOAP (PAOS) binding.
            3. HTTP redirect binding.
            4. HTTP post binding.
            5. HTTP artifact binding.
            6. SAML URI binding.

        # --------- HTTP post binding:
             when the client reponsible to exchange SAML assertion with SP through POST request.
        
        # --------- HTTP redirect binding:
            when SP redirect the user to authenticate with IdP, after authnetication IdP will redirect back the client to the SP along with SAML assertion.

        # --------- HTTP artifact binding:
            After the client authenticate with IdP, IdP issue SAML artifact and SAML assertion:
                1. SAML artifact contains token point to SAML assertion that stored at IdP, IdP send SAMl artifact to the client.
                2. Client starts to send it to the SP.
                3. SP exchange SAML artifact with IdP to gain the right SAML assertion that belong to the client. 

    # --------- Security faults:
        1. SP doesn't check the signature of SAML assertion that allow attacker to change SAML NameID without change signature or even (Signature stripping) blank 
        the signature that found:
            - <ds:DigestValue></ds:DIgestValue>
            - <ds:SignatureValue></ds:SignatureValue>

        1. SAML tracer: Firefox extension.
