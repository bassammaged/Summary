    ==> Quick view: By manipulating the HTTP verb it was possible to bypass the authorization on this directory. 
                    The scanner sent a request with a custom HTTP verb (WVS in this case) and managed to bypass the authorization. 
                    The attacker can also try any of the valid HTTP verbs, such as HEAD, TRACE, TRACK, PUT, DELETE, and many more.

                    - OPTIONS: check the avialable http verbs.
                    - PUT: it allows upload file.
                    - DELETE: it allows remove file from server.
