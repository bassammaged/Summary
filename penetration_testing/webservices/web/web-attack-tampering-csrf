    ==> Quick view: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end 
                    user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which theyâ€™re 
                    currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, 
                    not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request.

    # ---------- Attack scenario:
        step 1: ensure the web application verify only on session value that send through cookie.
        step 2: ensure victim has a valid and active session when the malicious request is executed.
        step 3: extra: you can bypass csrf token with many techniques.
            - remove token.
            - fixed value.
            - token equal to null.
            - change the request.
            - CSRF token is not tied to the user session.
            - CSRF token is tied to a non-session cookie. (hard to exploit, its need to allow attacker to set a cookie (CRLF vulnuerability) with 
            valid associated csrf token).
            - CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie.
            - CSRF token could be not validated if referer header is omitted.
            - CSRF Could be mitigated based on referer header, send the request with no referer header.
            - CSRF Could be mitigated based on referer header, Back-end valid if the referer contains the website domain or not. 
            - chain CORS or XSS for extracting CSRF token.  
        step 4: the victim browse your mailicious form with auto submit.

    # ---------- Impact:
        - unwanted on behalf of the user/admin leads to RCE, account takeover, etc.. 

    # ---------- mitigation:
        - Check referer header.
        - Unpredictable anti-csrf token
