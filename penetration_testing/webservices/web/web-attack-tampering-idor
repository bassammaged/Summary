    ==> Quick view: There can be many variables in the application such as “id”, “pid”, 
                    “uid”. Although these values are often seen as HTTP parameters, they can be found 
                    in headers and cookies. The attacker can access, edit or delete any of other users’ 
                    objects by changing the values. This vulnerability is called IDOR.
