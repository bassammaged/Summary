# ------------------------------- start same origin policy overview ------------------------------- # 
    ==> Quick view: Two URLs have the same origin if the protocol, port (if specified), and host are the same for both. 
                    The following table gives examples of origin comparisons with the URL http://store.company.com/dir/page.html:
                    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    |                    URL                            | Outcome	    |   Reason                  |
                    |   http://store.company.com/dir2/other.html        | Same origin	|   Only the path differs   |
                    |   http://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html	| Same origin	|   Only the path differs   |
                    |   https://store.company.com/page.html	        	| Failure   	|   Different protocol      |
                    |   http://store.company.com:81/dir/page.html		| Failure   	|   Different port          |
                    |   http://news.company.com/dir/page.html			| Failure   	|   Different host          |

    # ---------- |start Inherited origins| ---------- #
        ==> Quick View: Scripts executed from pages with an about:blank or javascript: URL inherit the origin of the document 
                        containing that URL, since these types of URLs do not contain information about an origin server.

                        execluded from SOP images,css,js
    # ---------- |  end Inherited origins| ---------- #

    # ---------- |start Exceptions in Internet Explorer| ---------- #
        - Port, IE doesn't include port into same-origin checks
        - Trust Zones: If both domains are in the highly trusted zone (e.g. corporate intranet domains),
                       then the same-origin limitations are not applied.
    # ---------- |  end Exceptions in Internet Explorer| ---------- #
    
    # ---------- |start Changing origin| ---------- #
        ==> Quick View: A page may change its own origin, with some limitations. A script can set the value of document.domain 
                        to its current domain or a superdomain of its current domain. If set to a superdomain of the current domain, 
                        the shorter superdomain is used for same-origin checks. 

                        For example, assume a script from the document at http://store.company.com/dir/other.html executes the following:
                        document.domain = "company.com";

         ==> V.I Note: When using document.domain to allow a subdomain to access its parent securely, you need to set 
                       document.domain to the same value in both the parent domain and the subdomain. This is necessary even if 
                       doing so is simply setting the parent domain back to its original value. Failure to do this may result in 
                       permission errors.

    # ---------- |start Cross-origin script API access| ---------- #
        ==> Quick View: JavaScript APIs like iframe.contentWindow, window.parent, window.open, and window.opener allow documents to directly 
                        reference each other. When two documents do not have the same origin, these references provide very limited access to 
                        Window and Location objects, as described in the next two sections. 
                        To communicate between documents from different origins, use window.postMessage.

        - windows objects:
            - Methods
                window.blur
                window.close
                window.focus
                window.postMessage
        
            - attributes:
                -------------------------------------
                | window.closed     |   Read only.  |
                | window.frames     |   Read only.  |
                | window.length     |   Read only.  |
                | window.location   |   Read/Write. |
                | window.opener     |   Read only.  |
                | window.parent     |   Read only.  |
                | window.self       |   Read only.  |
                | window.top        |   Read only.  |
                | window.window     |   Read only.  |
                -------------------------------------

            ==> V.I Note: Some browsers allow access to more properties than the above.

        - Location objects:
            - Methods
                location.replace
            - Attributes
                -------------------------------------
                | URLUtils.href     |   Write only. |
