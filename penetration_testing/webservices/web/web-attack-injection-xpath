    ==> Quick view: XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path expressions look very much like the expressions 
    you see when you work with a traditional computer file system. XPath expressions can be used in 
    JavaScript, Java, XML Schema, PHP, Python, C and C++, and lots of other languages.
