    ==> Quick view: If the authentication check in sensitive request handlers is insufficient or non-existent 
                    the vulnerability can be categorised as Missing Function Level Access Control.
                    Example of a common type of this vulnerability would be to simply hide a feature from the user,
                    but allowing the request if the user is able to figure out how to conduct it.
