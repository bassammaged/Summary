    # ------- What is SSI:
        - SSI stands for server side includes, Basically server side includes are directives which you can place into your HTML (or other) documents 
        to execute scripts or output, for example, environment variables or file statistics.

        - SSI are an Apache feature implemented by mod_include. This feature allows us to place special code 'elements' in our documents 
        which will carry out certain actions as specified. When a page is sent from the server to the requesting client the page is scanned by 
        the server for the SSI code elements and carry's out the required actions based on the code element.

        - Files with the extension .shtml (or others as explained later) are processed by the server for SSI.

        # ------- What can SSI be used for? 
            - SSI can be used for many great things! Their primary uses are to provide interactivity to a web site and to aid site maintenance! 
            For example, content which is common to all your web pages can be placed in a single document and then included on ALL your 
            pages. To make any changes you only need to modify this source document!

            - Displaying document information such as document name, URI, modified date, file size.
            - Using the "echo command" you can 'echo' environmental variables.
            - User information such as IP address or browser information.
            - Redirect user.
            - Perform query and update a database.
            - Send an email.
