# ------------------------------- start Information Disclosure ------------------------------- #
    # ----- What is Information Disclosure?
        - Information disclosure is when an application fails to properly protect sensitive and confidential information from parties that 
        are not supposed to have access to the subject matter in normal circumstances. These type of issues are not exploitable in most cases, but are 
        considered as web application security issues because they allows malicious hackers to gather relevant information which can be used later in 
        the attack lifecycle, in order to achieve more than they could if they didnâ€™t get access to such information.

    # ----- What are the type of Information Disclosure?
        - Banner Grabbing/Active Reconnaissance.
        - Source Code Disclosure
        - Inappropriate Handling of Sensitive Data
        - File Name & File Path Disclosure
        - Data about other users, such as usernames or financial information
        - Sensitive commercial or business data
        - etc...

    # ----- Examples on information disclosure:
        - Revealing the names of hidden directories, their structure, and their contents via a robots.txt file or directory listing
        - Providing access to source code files via temporary backups
        - Explicitly mentioning database table or column names in error messages
        - Unnecessarily exposing highly sensitive information, such as credit card details
        - Hard-coding API keys, IP addresses, database credentials, and so on in the source code
        - Hinting at the existence or absence of resources, usernames, and so on via subtle differences in application behavior

    # ----- How to assess the severity of information disclosure vulnerabilities?
        - Although the ultimate impact can potentially be very severe, it is only in specific circumstances that information disclosure is a high-severity 
        issue on its own. During testing, the disclosure of technical information in particular is often only of interest if you are able to demonstrate 
        how an attacker could do something harmful with it.

    
    # ----- How to find information disclosure?
        - Fuzzing.
        - Content Discovery.
        - Change the request method.
        - Parameter tempering.
        - Engineering informative responses.
        - Analysis the 302 response.
        - Debuging mode.
        - Search for backups.
        - check robots.txt, sitemap.xml
        - Insecure configuration
        - version control history, for example .git, /.git

    # ----- How to prevent information disclosure vulnerabilities?
        - Make sure that everyone involved in producing the website is fully aware of what information is considered sensitive. Sometimes seemingly 
        harmless information can be much more useful to an attacker than people realize. Highlighting these dangers can help make sure that sensitive 
        information is handled more securely in general by your organization.
        - Audit any code for potential information disclosure as part of your QA or build processes. It should be relatively easy to 
        automate some of the associated tasks, such as stripping developer comments.
        - Use generic error messages as much as possible. Don't provide attackers with clues about application behavior unnecessarily.
        - Double-check that any debugging or diagnostic features are disabled in the production environment.
        - Make sure you fully understand the configuration settings, and security implications, of any third-party technology that you 
        implement. Take the time to investigate and disable any features and settings that you don't actually need.

        - Burp Intruder.
        - Burp Scanner.
        - Logger++ Burp extension: to log all requests that sent by burp and analysis them.
        - Burp Engagement tool
