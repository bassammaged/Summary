# ----- Java Development Kit (JDK)
    - As the name suggests this is complete java development kit that includes JRE (Java Runtime Environment), compilers and various tools like JavaDoc, Java debugger etc.
    In order to create, compile and run Java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.
    - JDK is a software development environment used for making applets and Java applications. The full form of JDK is Java Development Kit. Java developers can use 
    it on Windows, macOS, Solaris, and Linux. JDK helps them to code and run Java programs. It is possible to install more than one JDK version on the same computer.

    # ----- Why use JDK?
        - JDK contains tools required to write Java programs, and JRE to execute them.
        - It includes a compiler, Java application launcher, Appletviewer, etc.
        - Compiler converts code written in Java into byte code.
        - Java application launcher opens a JRE, loads the necessary class, and executes its main method.

    # ----- Features of JDK
        - It enables you to handle multiple extensions in a single catch block.
        - JDK includes all features that JRE has.
        - It contains development tools such as a compiler, debugger, etc.
        - JDK provides the environment to develop and execute Java source code.
        - It can be installed on Windows, Unix, and Mac operating systems.
        - Diamond operator can be used in specifying a generic type interface instead of writing the exact one.


# ----- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    - JRE is a piece of a software which is designed to run other software. It contains the class libraries, loader class, and JVM. In simple terms, if you want 
    to run Java program you need JRE. If you are not a programmer, you don't need to install JDK, but just JRE to run Java programs. Though, all JDK versions comes 
    bundled with Java Runtime Environment, so you do not need to download and install the JRE separately in your PC. The full form of JRE is Java Runtime Environment.

    # ----- Why use JRE?
        - JRE contains class libraries, JVM, and other supporting files. It does not contain any tool for Java development like a debugger, compiler, etc.
        - It uses important package classes like math, swingetc, util, lang, awt, and runtime libraries.
        - If you have to run Java applets, then JRE must be installed in your system.

    # ----- Features of JRE
        - Java Runtime Environment is a set of tools using which the JVM actually runs.
        - JRE contains deployment technology, including Java Web Start and Java Plug-in.
        - Developers can easily run the source code in JRE, but he/she cannot write and compile the Java program.
        - It includes integration libraries like Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), and more.
        - JRE has JVM and Java HotSpot virtual machine client.

# ----- Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
    - JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts Java bytecode into machine language. JVM is a part 
    of Java Run Environment (JRE). It cannot be separately downloaded and installed. To install JVM, you need to install JRE. The full form of JVM is Java Virtual Machine.

    # ----- Why JVM?
        - JVM provides a platform-independent way of executing Java source code.
        - It has numerous libraries, tools, and frameworks.
        - Once you run Java program, you can run on any platform and save lots of time.
        - JVM comes with JIT(Just-in-Time) compiler that converts Java source code into low-level machine language. Hence, it runs more faster as a regular application.

    # ----- Features of JVM
        - It enables you to run applications in a cloud environment or in your device.
        - Java Virtual Machine converts byte code to the machine-specific code.
        - It provides basic java functions like memory management, security, garbage collection, and more.
        - JVM runs the program by using libraries and files given by Java Runtime Environment.
        - JDK and JRE both contain Java Virtual Machine.
        - It can execute the java program line by line hence it is also called as interpreter.
        - JVM is easily customizable for example, you can allocate minimum and maximum memory to it.
        - It is independent from hardware and the operating system. So, you can write a java program once and run anywhere.


# -----  Bytecode
    - Bytecode in Java is the reason java is platform-independent, as soon as a  Java program is compiled bytecode is generated. To be more precise a Java bytecode 
    is the machine code in the form of a .class file. A bytecode in Java is the instruction set for Java Virtual Machine and acts similar to an assembler.
