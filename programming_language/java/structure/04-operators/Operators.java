        # ----- Types of Operator in Java:
            - Basic Arithmetic Operators.
            - Assignment Operators.
            - Auto-Increment and Auto-Decrement Operators.
            - Logical Operators.
            - Comparison Operators.
            - Bitwise Operators.

        # ----- Basic Arithmetic Operators:
        + is for addition.
        – is for subtraction.
        * is for multiplication.
        / is for division.
        % is for modulo.
        
        # ----- Assignment Operators:
            num2 = num1 would assign value of variable num1 to the variable.
            num2+=num1 is equal to num2 = num2+num1
            num2-=num1 is equal to num2 = num2-num1
            num2*=num1 is equal to num2 = num2*num1
            num2/=num1 is equal to num2 = num2/num1
            num2%=num1 is equal to num2 = num2%num1

        # ----- Auto-increment and Auto-decrement Operators:
            num++ is equivalent to num=num+1;
            num–- is equivalent to num=num-1;
        
        # ----- Logical Operators:
            b1&&b2 will return true if both b1 and b2 are true else it would return false.
            b1||b2 will return false if both b1 and b2 are false else it would return true.
            !b1 would return the opposite of b1, that means it would be true if b1 is false and it would return

        # ----- Comparison(Relational) Operators:
            == returns true if both the left side and right side are equal
            != returns true if left side is not equal to the right side of operator.
            > returns true if left side is greater than right.
            < returns true if left side is less than right side.
            >= returns true if left side is greater than or equal to right side.
            <= returns true if left side is less than or equal to right side.
        
        # ----- Bitwise Operators:
            num1 & num2     compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if both bits are equal, else it returns 0.
            num1 | num2     compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if either bit is 1, else it returns 0.
            num1 ^ num2     compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if they are not equal, else it returns 0.
            ~num1           is a complement operator that just changes the bit from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. 
            num1 << 2       is left shift operator that moves the bits to the left, discards the far left bit, and assigns the rightmost bit a value of 0.
            num1 >> 2       is right shift operator that moves the bits to the right, discards the far right bit, and assigns the leftmost bit a value of 0.
