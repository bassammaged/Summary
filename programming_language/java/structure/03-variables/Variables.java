    # ------ Declare variable:
        - To declare a variable follow this syntax:
            data_type variable_name = value;

        # ----- Variables Types:
            - byte          stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, hold whole number between -128 and 127
            - short         stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, Its range is -32,768 to 32767.
            - int           stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, its range is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
            - long          stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

            - float         stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
            - double        stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99

            - String        stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
            - char          stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
            - boolean       stores values with two states: true or false

            - <type>[]      stores array of same attributes, for example: int[] numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

        # ----- Variables naming convention in java
            - Variables naming cannot contain white spaces, for example: int num ber = 100; is invalid because the variable name has space in it.
            - Variable name can begin with special characters such as $ and _
            - As per the java coding standards the variable name should begin with a lower case letter, for example int number; For lengthy 
            variables names that has more than one words do it like this: int smallNumber; int bigNumber; (start the second word with capital letter).
            - Variable names are case sensitive in Java.

    # ----- Types of Variables in Java:
        1. Local variable.
            - These variables are declared inside method of the class. Their scope is limited to the method which means that You canâ€™t change their values and 
            access them outside of the method.
        2. Static (or class) variable.
            - Static variables are also known as class variable because they are associated with the class and common for all the instances of class. For example, 
            If I create three objects of a class and access this static variable, it would be common for all.
        3. Instance variable.
            - Each instance(objects) of class has its own copy of instance variable. Unlike static variable, instance variables have their own separate 
            copy of instance variable.
