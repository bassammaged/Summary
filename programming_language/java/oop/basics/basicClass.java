    # ----- What is oop?
        OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Javaâ€™s Object Oriented Programming. They are an abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Grasping 
        them is key to understanding how Java works. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without 
        compromising security.

    # ----- Component of class:
        - Attributes:
            Object attributes is the data bundled in an instance of a class. The object attributes are called instance variables or member fields. An instance 
            variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each object in the class has a separate copy.
        - Methods:
            A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform 
            certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
