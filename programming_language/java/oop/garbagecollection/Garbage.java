    # ----- Garbage Collection in Java?
        - When JVM starts up, it creates a heap area which is known as runtime data area. This is where all the objects (instances of class) are stored. Since this 
        area is limited, it is required to manage this area efficiently by removing the objects that are no longer in use.

        - The process of removing unused objects from heap memory is known as Garbage collection.
