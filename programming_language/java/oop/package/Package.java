    # ----- What is package?
        - A package as the name suggests is a pack(group) of classes, interfaces and other packages. In java we use packages to organize our 
        classes and interfaces. We have two types of packages in Java:
            1. built-in packages.
            2. user defined packages.

        - In java we have several built-in packages, for example:
            import java.util.Scanner

            1. java is a top level package.
            2. util is a sub package.
            3. Scanner is a class which present in the sub package util.

    # ----- Advantages of using a package in Java:
        1. Reusability: While developing a project in java, we often feel that there are few things that we are writing again and again in our code. Using packages, you can 
        create such things in form of classes inside a package and whenever you need to perform that same task, just import that package and use the class.
        
        2. Better Organization: Again, in large java projects where we have several hundreds of classes, it is always required to group the similar types of classes 
        in a meaningful package name so that you can organize your project better.
        
        3. Name Conflicts: We can define two classes with the same name in different packages so to avoid name collision, we can use packages.
