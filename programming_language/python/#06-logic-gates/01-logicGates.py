    # -------------- what is logic gates
        A Logic gate is an elementary building block of any digital circuits. It takes one or two inputs and produces output based on those 
        inputs. Outputs may be high (1) or low (0). Logic gates are implemented using diodes or transistors. It can also be constructed using 
        vacuum tubes, electromagnetic elements like optics, molecules, etc. In a computer, most of the electronic circuits are made up 
        logic gates. Logic gates are used to create a circuit that performs calculations, data storage or shows off object-oriented programming 
        especially the power of inheritance. 
        
        There are seven basic logic gates defined, these are: AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate , XOR gate, and XNOR gate.

    # -------------- Logic gates:
        AND                     The AND gate gives an output of 1 if both the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise. 
        NAND                    The NAND gate (negated AND) gives an output of 0 if both inputs are 1, it gives 1 otherwise. 
        OR                      The OR gate gives an output of 1 if either of the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise.  
        XOR                     The XOR gate gives an output of 1 if either both inputs are different, it gives 0 if they are same. 
        XNOR                    The XNOR gate (negated XOR) gives an output of 1 both inputs are same and 0 if both are different. 
        NOT                     It acts as an inverter. It takes only one input. If the input is given as 1, it will invert the result as 0 and vice-versa.
