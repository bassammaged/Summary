- Why Learn Python?
    1- Data Science & Machine Learning
        Data is the base in this subject, doesn’t matter what field you want to be in, it’s going to be there. Python is one of the commonly 
        used programming languages for Data Science and Machine Learning. 
    2- Main applications & more.
        Data Science — including machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization —, Web Development and Scripting are the three main applications of Python.
    3- Extensive Libraries & Framework.
        Python provides libraries that include the areas like string operations, Internet, web service tools, 
        operating system interfaces and protocols. Python Package Index includes more than 85,000 modules and scripts to be used.
    4- Open Source.
        For more than 20 years, Python has been cross-platform and open source. You can code on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
    5- Can work with other programming languages.
        CPython to work with C programming language, Jython for Python integrated with Java, IronPython is the compatibility with .NET 
        and C#, PyObjc is Python written with ObjectiveC toolkits and RubyPython the version combined with Ruby.
    6- Improving productivity.
        Python lets you build more functions with less code, for example you can build a rudimentary game in two days.
    7- Jobs & Careers.
        Your career as a programmer can grow along with Python every day. First, Python is getting to be the major programming language, so it’s a benefit know to 
        work with it.
