Hopin' that I make this time
But I'm so done with hopin
'Cause hopin' is to, falling' is to
Fallin' down this mountain, fallin' in again
Boom-boom, heartbeats still beatin' in the end
I'm chokin'
But that's just what they wanted
So I get up off the ground and I shake it out, ra da da
Come look at me now, look at me now
I am not here to talk, I am not here to talk
I am just here to walk, here to walk the walk

So mark my words before you swallow yours just like a bill
