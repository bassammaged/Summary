- What is namespace?
    - A namespace is a system to have a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method. 
    - Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace. So, the 
      division of the word itself gives little more information. Its Name (which means name, an unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope). 

    Types of namespaces:
        When Python interpreter runs solely without and user-defined modules, methods, classes, etc. Some functions like print(), id() are always present, 
        these are built in namespaces. When a user creates a module, a global namespace gets created, later creation of local functions creates the local namespace. 
        The built-in namespace encompasses global namespace and global namespace encompasses local namespace.

    example:
        # var1 is in the global namespace  
        var1 = 5
        def some_func(): 
        
            # var2 is in the local namespace  
            var2 = 6
            def some_inner_func(): 
        
                # var3 is in the nested local  
                # namespace 
                var3 = 7
