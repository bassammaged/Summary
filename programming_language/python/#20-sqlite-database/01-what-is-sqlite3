# ----- What is sqllite3:
    SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used 
    database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people
    use every day. More Information...

# ----- When to use sqlite3:
     SQLite is not directly comparable to client/server SQL database engines such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server since SQLite is trying to solve a 
     different problem. Client/server SQL database engines strive to implement a shared repository of enterprise data. They emphasize scalability, 
     concurrency, centralization, and control. SQLite strives to provide local data storage for individual applications and devices. SQLite emphasizes economy, 
     efficiency, reliability, independence, and simplicity. 

     # ----- Situations Where SQLite Works Well:
        - Embedded devices and the internet of things
        - Application file format
        - Limit web app. traffic
        - Internal or temporary databases
        - etc...

# ----- Disadvatage of sqlite3:
    - SQLite only supports one writer at a time per database file.
    - When it comes to data separated from the application by a network, SQLite is built into the application.
    - Your data is Big data, If your data will grow to a size that you are uncomfortable or unable to fit into a single disk file then you should select a 
    solution other than SQLite.
