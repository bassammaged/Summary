# -------------  Error, what is mean?
    - Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution.

# ------------- Types of error in python:
    - Syntax Error
        As the name suggest this error is caused by wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program.
    - Exception Error
         Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution 
         of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.
