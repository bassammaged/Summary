    ==> Quick view: The Go Programming Language, also commonly referred to as Golang, is a general-purpose programming language, 
                    developed by a team at Google. The Go language was conceived in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google. 
                    Go first appeared in November 2009,

                    Go project is: http://golang.org/

    ==> Library at Go: Go provides a comprehensive standard library. The standard library provides all the core packages programmers need to build real-world, 
                        web and network-based programs.

    ==> Go properties:
                        - Statically typed.
                        - Natively compiled.
                        - Garbage-collected.
                        - Concurrent programming language.
                        - Goroutine.
                        - Belongs primarily to the C family of languages in terms of basic syntax.
                        - Go struct.
                        - Go Interface.

    ==> Why GoLang?!
                        - Go compiles quickly to machine code.
                        - Power of run-time reflection
                        - Garbage-collected.
                        - Concurrency in Go.
                            Is the ability for functions to run independent of each other. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs 
                            that get the most out of multi core and networked machines,
                        - Goroutine.
                            It's treated as an independent unit of work that gets scheduled and then executed on an available logical processor.
                        - Statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
                        - Library at Go.
