	# ----- What is anonymous function in golang?
		- Go language provides a special feature known as an anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function which doesnâ€™t contain any name. It is useful
		 when you want to create an inline function. In Go language, an anonymous function can form a closure. An anonymous function is also known as function literal.

		 - In Go language, you are allowed to assign an anonymous function to a variable. When you assign a function to a variable, then the type of the variable
		  is of function type and you can call that variable like a function call.
